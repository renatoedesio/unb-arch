\replaced{Due to space scarcity, in this section we report most recent work that leveraged the discussion comparing accuracy and effectiveness of recovery techniques.}{Maintenance and evolution of software systems is an expensive and challenging task. For this reason, several approaches for the recovery of software architecture have been proposed. Ducasse et al. in \cite{ducasse_software_2009} present a taxonomy of approaches to architecture recovery, detailing information necessary for recovery, such as: what the stakeholdersâ€™ goals are, how the general reconstruction proceeds, what the available sources of information are. Based on this, which techniques one can apply and what kind of knowledge the process provides.}

Garcia \textit{et al.} \cite{Garcia:ASE2013} performed a comparative analysis of six automated architecture recovery techniques. The selected techniques rely on two kinds of input obtained from im\-ple\-mentation-level artifacts: textual and structural. The accuracy of the techniques were assessed on eight architectures from six different open-source systems. Their results indicated that two of the selected recovery techniques are superior to the rest along multiple measures. However, the results also show that there is significant room for improvement in all of the studied techniques, particularly w.r.t accuracy.

Lutellier \textit{et al.} \cite{Lutellier_2015} compared nine variants of six architecture recovery techniques using two different types of dependencies: symbol and include. Four of the selected techniques use dependencies to determine clusters, while the remaining two techniques use textual information from source code. The results shows that symbol dependencies generally produce architectures with higher accuracies than include dependencies. Despite this improvement, the overall accuracy is low for all recovery techniques.

Regarding the context of semi-automatic techniques, Wettel \textit{et al.} \cite{wettel_software_2011} carried out a controlled experiment to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of the CodeCity software visualization tool in the process of understanding a software system structure. Results pointed out that analysis via CodeCity was possible to obtain an accuracy of 24.26\% and a reduction of 12.01\% in the execution time of a certain number of tasks, when compared to an understanding process carried out via a manual inspection of the source code.
